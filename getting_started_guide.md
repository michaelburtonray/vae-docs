# Getting Started {#getting_started_guide}

VaeML is an exteremely powerful tag-based language that is coded
directly within your HTML or Haml source code. Our [VaeML tag
reference](#vaeml) contains a full description of each tag, as well as
all of their possible attributes.

If you're a newcomer, it might be a good idea to familiarize yourself
with the tag list, but by no means do you have to learn their
functionalities all at once. A good place to see how some of the more
common tags work is our [Example Site](#example_site) tutorial.

The main tags you'll need to create a basic site are the
[`<v:section>`](#v_section), [`<v:collection>`](#v_collection),
[`<v:text>`](#v_text), [`<v:img>`](#v_img), and [`<v:a>`](#v_a) tags. If
you're creating a store for the first time, our [eCommerce
section](#ecommerce) contains a useful guide that will show you how to
use VaeML to create a shopping flow for your eCommerce site.
