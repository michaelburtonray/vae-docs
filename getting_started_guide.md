# VaeML

VaeML is our meta-language that you can mix in with your HTML code to
render your data onto webpages. VaeML is automatically parsed in any
file ending in `.html`, `.php`, `.haml`, `.rss`, or `.xml`.

VaeML is easy to learn, yet extremely powerful in practice. You can
build amazingly complicated websites using VaeML.

If you are reading this guide straight through, it is probably worth
skimming through each tag to see all the things that are possible
in VaeML. Beyond that, it is mostly useful as a reference.
