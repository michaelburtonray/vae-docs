# VaeML

VaeML is our meta-language that you can mix in with your HTML code to
render your data onto webpages. VaeML is automatically parsed in any
file ending in `.html`, `.php`, `.haml`, `.rss`, or `.xml`.

VaeML is easy to learn, yet extremely powerful in practice. You can
build amazingly complicated websites using VaeML.

## Main Tags

The main tags are the VaeML tags that are most commonly used.

## Store/eCommerce Tags

Store/eCommerce tags are used to create an eCommerce application on your
website. With the VaeML Store tags, you can create a full-featured
shopping cart and checkout flow. Because the interaction is hand-built
by the designer using VaeML tags, you can customize almost every aspect
of your online store.

## User Registration Tags

User registration tags are used to allow visitors to your website to log
in or register for an account. This can be used to create members-only
sections, to authenticate comment posting for a blog, or for any number
of other community functions.

To use user registration, simply create a root-level collection to hold
your users. Then create any structures inside it to hold information
about your users. You will likely want a structure for E-Mail address
and password, at a minimum. We plan to soon write a tutorial page about
user registration.

## Form Item Tags

Form Item tags are used to build context-aware forms on Vae. Each of
these tags renders an HTML form or input tag, but it will automatically
populate values where appropriate, as well as supporting complex
validations, both on the client and server side.
