# Content Management {#content_management}

As we discussed in the previous chapter, Vae doesn't make assumptions
about what kind of content your website contains or how it should be
organized and displayed. It is up to you, the designer, to tell Vae
exactly what kind of content you want to manage, and how different
components relate together. No coding is required to do this; it is all
done through the Vae application itself.

In this chapter, we will explain how Vae organizes content and walk you
through several examples. Some sections of this chapter are intended for
reference and can be skimmed over if you are reading this book straight
through.
