# Simple Structures {#simple_structures}

Simple structures are the most basic types of data structures within
Vae. Each simple structure holds one piece of data. There are currently
10 types of simple structures.

The primary difference between the simple structures are the input
widgets. For example, a Checkbox structure will present the user with a
checkbox, while a Color structure will present the user with a color
picker.

Of course, there are also differences in how you access the data.
Text-based structures such as the Text structure, Text Area structure,
or Rich Text structure are typically output as text using the `<v:text>`
tag in VaeML, while file-based structures are typically output using the
`<v:file>` or `<v:img>` tags in VaeML. Don't worry too much about that
for now, we'll come back to it later.

Full details about each type of structure are included here for
reference, so if you are reading the book straight through, it is okay
to just skim each simple structure to gain a level of familiarity
without stressing the details.
