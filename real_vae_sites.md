# A Sampling of Vae Sites

Seeing is believing, so let's take a moment to check out some of the
different sites that have been built on Vae. Later, we'll circle back
and explore how some of them are managing their content, and how they've
integrated the content into their HTML code by using VaeML.

Here are 9 sites that we like a lot:

-   [Allido Records](http://www.allidorecords.com/)

-   [American Dictation](http://www.americandictation.com/)

-   [Bobble](http://www.waterbobble.com/)

-   [Colossal Media](http://www.colossalmedia.com/)

-   [Hint Fashion Magazine](http://www.hintmag.com/)

-   [Impose Magazine](http://www.imposemagazine.com/)

-   [Olsenboye](http://www.olsenboye.com/)

-   [Peeptoe Shoes](http://www.peeptoeshoes.com.au/)

-   [Sam Edelman](http://www.samedelman.com/)

We picked these sites because they display a wide variety of ways that
Vae can be used. Some are magazines/blogs, others are online stores.
Some have both. The Bobble site uses Flash, and the Sam Edelman site
uses video. Hint Magazine showcases our built-in integration with Disqus
for commenting, and American Dictation is a great example of how to
build an SEO-friendly online store.

Just to reiterate, these websites look nothing alike. But they (and
hundreds of others) are all being managed with 's content mangament and
eCommerce facilities.
