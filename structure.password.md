# Password

The Password Structure stores a password securely with encryption. It is
generally used with the [`<v:users:login>`](#v_users_login) and
[`<v:users:register>`](#v_store_register) to create a members only area
on your website.

## Backstage Look and Feel

The Password structure shows in the backstage as a standard password
entry box:

Because passwords are stored encrypted, the current password is never
shown. Entering a value will change the stored password.
