# Web Professionals Required

As a company, we frequently come under pressure from investors and
friends to make the Vae platform more accessible to nontechnical
designers. They want us to offer templates, pre-built sites, and wizards
to make it easier for individuals to create their own websites using Vae
without having to learn HTML.

These people don't get it. Vae was designed to make it easy to create
the best websites, and the best websites are always custom-built -- to
the exact specifications of each and every client. We believe that every
website should be designed by a professional web designer that is
intimately familar with HTML, CSS, FTP, and any other technologies that
may be necessary. Template-based websites will never be good enough for
us.

As such, we assume that anyone using Vae will be a good web designer who
has this knowledge. If you do not understand HTML, CSS, and a little
Javascript, Vae is probably not for you. Go develop these skills and
come back to us. Call us perfectionists, but we only want to be
associated with designers that are the cream of the crop.

We don't have any CSS editors, "visual style editors", templates, or
wizards. We give you full access to HTML, CSS, and PHP and a powerful
content presentation language called VaeML. Setting up content
management takes work, but in time it will be second nature and you will
be an even better designer than you were before.
