# Superstructures

Superstructures are structures that contain other structures. They are
used to organize your content into a meaningful hierarchy. They are also
the only structures that can live at the top-level of your website. This
means that the first structure that you create must be a superstructure.

The two superstructures are the [Collection](#structure.collection) and
the [Section](#structure.section). The difference between the two is
that the Collection can hold multiple entries of data (think multiple
rows in a database), while the Section only has one entry (think about a
static text file).

Both types are immensely useful, and it is very common for a website to
have a mixture of Collections and Sections at the top-level. Common uses
for Collections include managing `Blog             Posts`, `Events`,
`Links`, or `Items`. Common uses for Sections include managing content
that exists in a single spot on your website such as
`Thought of the Day` or `Contact Information`.

The [External](#structure.external) structure isn't really a structure
at all, but it creates items that live at the top-level of your website,
so we include it here because that is the best place to fit it in this
guide.
