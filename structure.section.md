# Section {#structure.section}

A Section is a superstructure that may contain multiple child
structures, however it can only hold a single entry of data.

Sections are commonly used to hold content that is used either in a
specific place on the website or general settings that apply in various
locations on the website. For example, imagine a section called
`Look and Feel` that contains an Image structure called `Background` and
a color structure called `Text             Color`. You could have your
users upload a background image for their website and set a text color
that matches.
