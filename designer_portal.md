# Websites

The Websites tab is the area of the Designer Portal where you can
provision websites and log in to your existing websites.

The main page of the Website tab is a listing of all of your websites in
alphabetical order. Some statistical information about each website is
shown as well. Clicking on a website will take you directly into its
Backstage interface, which is where Content Managent is configured and
takes place.

If you do not yet have any websites, you will be shown a welcome screen
that contains the form that will enable you to create your first
website. It looks like this:

## Creating a new Website

To create and provision a new website, click the Add Website to your
Account link at the top right corner of the website list to bring up the
Add Website form. If you do not have any websites yet, the form will
already be showing on your page. The fields are as follows:

1.  Website Name - This is the name that will be shown for the website
    on its Backstage header, Backstage login screen, and in the
    Designer Portal. This can be changed later via the **Vae** &gt;
    **Vae Interface** subtab in the Backstage.

2.  Vae Address - This will become the URL for the website's Backstage
    (content management area), as well as the testing/development URL
    for the actual website. If you enter `example`, then the URL for the
    Backstage will become `http://example.vaeplatform.com/` and the
    testing/development URL for the website will be
    `http://example.vaesite.com/`.

    > **Caution**
    >
    > Although using a `www`-prefix will work for the actual website URL
    > (e.g.`http://www.example.vaesite.com/` will work), this will not
    > work for the Backstage URL
    > (e.g.`http://www.example.vaeplatform.com/` **will not work**).

3.  FTP Password - this is the password that you will use to upload
    files to this website via FTP. This can be changed later in the
    Site &gt; FTP subtab of the Backstage.

4.  Clone from another website - If you have any paying accounts, you
    may select one of them to clone. Doing this will create all the
    structures contained in the source site in the new site as well as
    copy all of the files from the FTP account of the source site to the
    new site. Actual content will not be copied.

    We have plans in the future to expand the power of this feature to
    allow designers to select which aspects of a website will be cloned.

# Account

The Account tab is the area of the Designer Portal where you can edit
your Designer Portal account details. On this screen you can change your
name, username, password, and E-Mail address. To make changes, simply
edit the proper form fields and press the Save button.
