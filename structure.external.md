# External

An External Structure is not really a structure at all, rather it simply
links to or embeds an external resources. External Structures are used
when you want to link your client to another backend such as WordPress
or your merchant bank.

External Structures provide a quick and simple way for your clients to
access any non-Vae website. Vae strives to be a system that is simple to
handoff to any client; allowing designers to store references to other
websites is part of our solution to this challenge.
