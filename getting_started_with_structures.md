# Getting Started with Structures {#getting_started_with_structures}

Structures can be created and managed on the Site tab's [Content
Management](#backstage.site.content_management) subtab. The [Content
Management](#backstage.site.content_management) tab section of this
guide includes step-by-step instructions on how to create and manage
structures.

If you are ready to jump in and start building, head over to [that
section of the manual](#backstage.site.content_management) and work
through it. Once you have created your structures, you can go to the
[Content](#backstage.content) tab to begin managing your content. Then
you can jump to the [The Website](#the_website) section of the guide to
learn how to integrate your structures into your website.

If you are reading this guide sequentially, just proceed to the next
section. You'll eventually make it to the discussion of the Site tab.
