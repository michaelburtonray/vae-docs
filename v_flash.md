# `<v:flash>`{#v_flash}

Renders any messages stored in the Vae flash bucket. These include error
messages generated by Vae Store and the Vae Users system, or by any Vae
extensions you've written or installed.

On Vae, the Flash bucket refers to a queue of messages that should be
displayed to the user. It is named **flash** because it refers to the
idea of flashing a message at the user, and it is not at all related to
Adobe Flash (although Adobe Flash works great on Vae too).

If you do not include this tag on a page, these messages will be
displayed before any [Vae forms](#v_form).

## Required Attributes

None.

## Optional Attributes

-   `flash` - name of the specific flash bucket to display. You can name
    your flash buckets to put different types of messages in
    different places. Just pass that name here and in the `flash`
    attribute of the forms that should send messages to this location.

## Self-closed

This tag is usually self-closed.

## Sample Usage

    <v:flash />
