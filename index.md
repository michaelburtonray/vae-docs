If you're reading this guide, you're probably a web designer or
developer. You know how important it is for every business to have a
website. Every business without a website is *losing business* to
businesses with websites. Even in a recession, the web design industry
is thriving. There is a massive demand for good web designers, because
not only does every business need a website, every business needs the
*best* website.

For a website to be the *best*, it needs to contain relevant and current
information. The website for a concert hall better have a full list of
upcoming shows, complete with their set times, prices, and other
information. It should also have photo galleries from previous shows,
the restaurant menu, reviews, press, and more. Visitors to the concert
hall website expect this information, and if it isn't there, they'll be
going to a different concert hall.

We call all of this information content. By definition, content is
constantly changing. Every day, new photos are taken, and new shows are
added to the lineup. The menu is tweaked, and new reviews are collected.
Web designers should provide their clients the ability to add and update
the content on their websites, and this is exactly what Vae does.

If you're a web designer and you're currently delivering websites with
static content hardcoded into HTML, you are doing your clients a
disservice, creating more work for yourself down the road, and reducing
your value by selling an inferior product. Fortunately, you're here now,
and we're going to have you delivering fresh, dynamic websites in no
time.

And if you're currently using a bulky CMS product, we hope that you'll
see Vae as a breath of fresh air.

Come follow along with us as we show you why Vae is the best way to
build websites for your clients.
