# Coupon Codes

The Coupon Codes sub-tab (located under the Store tab) is the place to
manage your coupon codes. If you include the relevant markup (as we
discussed earlier in the chapter), users will be able to enter in this
code before completing their order, immediately reducing their total
cost. Click the Create New button to bring up the new coupon screen. Vae
gives you a lot of options when setting up your coupon, such as
expiration date, minimum amount that must be spent before the coupon
code is valid, and several more.
